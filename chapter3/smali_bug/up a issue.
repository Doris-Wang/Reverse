I. What seems to be the problem?
Jasper: debug info '.param' can not be found in the outputs of 2.0.3 version, but the similar  exits in 1.4.0 version

II. What is the exact smali/baksmali command that you ran?
Jasper:
 The ok and not ok commands are below. Both jar file exits there.
 (1) ok: java -jar ~/Downloads/baksmali-1.4.jar -o baksmali-1.4 Hello.dex 
 (2) not ok: java -jar ~/Downloads/baksmali-2.0.3.jar -o baksmali-2.0.3 Hello.dex

III. What version of smali/baksmali are you using? What rom are you working
from?
Jasper:
 (1) ok is 1.4.0, not ok is 2.0.3.
 (2) no rom. Test for a simple java code.
	
IV. What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?


V. Please provide any additional information below: error messages, symptoms,
etc.

Jasper :
The process is below, and I archive all of them ( code, jars, dex ) in a .tar.bz2 file, attach it.
I test it in a dex file gengerate by Eclipse. All messages exits in output files. 
That's all, Thank you.

$ grep param . -r
./baksmali-1.4/Hello.smali:    .parameter
